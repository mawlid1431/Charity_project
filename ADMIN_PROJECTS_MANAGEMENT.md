SELECT id, title, status 
FROM projects

-- List all with IDs
SELECT id, title, status, created_at 
FROM projects 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

```sql
INSERT INTO projects (title, location, start_date, description, image_url, goal_amount, current_amount, status, category, featured)
VALUES (
  'Emergency Food Relief',
  'Disaster Affected Areas',
  '2024-03-01',
  'Providing food packages to 1000 families affected by recent floods.',
  'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593113598332-cd288d649433?w=800',
  40000,
  0,
  'active',
  'Food',
  true
)
RETURNING id, title;
```

### Step 2: Check Progress
```sql
SELECT 
  title,
  goal_amount,
  current_amount,
  ROUND((current_amount / goal_amount * 100)::numeric, 2) as progress,
  status
FROM projects
WHERE title = 'Emergency Food Relief';
```

### Step 3: Update When Goal Reached
