## 🆘 If You Get Errors After Deployment:

### 1. **404 on Page Refresh**
**Problem:** Routes don't work when refreshing
**Solution:** Configure your hosting for SPA routing

**Vercel:** Add `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

**Netlify:** Add `_redirects` file:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. **Supabase Connection Fails**
**Problem:** Can't connect to database
**Solution:** 
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check Supabase project is active

### 3. **Image Uploads Fail**
**Problem:** Storage policy errors
**Solution:**
- Run `FIX_STORAGE_SIMPLE.sql` in Supabase
- Verify storage buckets exist
- Check policies are created

### 4. **Admin Login Fails**
**Problem:** Can't login to `/admin`
**Solution:**
- Check `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set
- Verify environment variables in hosting platform
- Try hardcoded credentials for testing
