# üîß Fix Image Upload Error - Step by Step

## ‚ùå The Error You're Seeing:
```
StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy
```

This means the storage bucket policies are blocking your uploads.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Run This SQL File

### Option 1: Simple Fix (Recommended for Testing)
**File:** `FIX_STORAGE_SIMPLE.sql`

This allows **anyone** to upload images (less secure, but works immediately).

### Option 2: Secure Fix (For Production)
**File:** `FIX_STORAGE_POLICIES.sql`

This only allows **authenticated admins** to upload (more secure, but requires proper login).

### Check 3: Verify Buckets Exist
In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage:
- All 3 buckets should exist
- All should be marked "Public"

## üéØ What Each SQL File Does:

### FIX_STORAGE_SIMPLE.sql
```
‚úì Removes all old policies
‚úì Creates new policies that allow ANYONE to upload
‚úì Good for testing/development
‚úì Less secure (anyone can upload)
```

### FIX_STORAGE_POLICIES.sql
```
‚úì Removes all old policies
‚úì Creates new policies that only allow AUTHENTICATED users
‚úì Good for production
‚úì More secure (only logged-in admins can upload)
```

### COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql
```
‚úì Creates all tables
‚úì Creates storage buckets
‚úì Creates storage policies (authenticated only)
‚úì Adds sample data
‚úì Complete setup in one file
```

---

## üí° Quick Troubleshooting:

### Error: "bucket does not exist"
**Solution:** Run `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` first

### Error: "policy already exists"
**Solution:** The SQL files drop old policies first, so just run them again

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged into Supabase as the project owner

### Error: Still getting 400 error
**Solution:** 
1. Run `FIX_STORAGE_SIMPLE.sql` (allows all uploads)
2. Test if upload works
3. If yes, the issue was authentication
4. If no, check Supabase logs for more details

---

## üöÄ Recommended Steps (In Order):

1. ‚úÖ Run `FIX_STORAGE_SIMPLE.sql` (quick fix)
2. ‚úÖ Test image upload in `/admin`
3. ‚úÖ If it works, you're done!
4. ‚úÖ Later, run `FIX_STORAGE_POLICIES.sql` for better security

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If uploads still fail after running the SQL:

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Policies**
   - Should see policies for each bucket
   - Should show "Public" or "Authenticated" access

2. **Check Browser Network Tab (F12)**
   - Look at the failed request
   - Check the response body for error details

3. **Try Manual Upload in Supabase**
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí project-images
   - Try uploading a file manually
   - If this fails, there's a bucket configuration issue

4. **Verify .env File**
   - Make sure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is correct
   - Make sure `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is correct
   - Restart your dev server after changing .env
