# ✅ Frontend Connected to Database!

## 🎉 What's Connected:

### Public Website (Frontend):
- ✅ **Homepage** - Shows real projects from database
- ✅ **Projects Page** - Lists all active projects
- ✅ **Donation Form** - Saves donations to database
- ✅ **Loading States** - Spinners while fetching data
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Fallback if database fails

### Admin Dashboard:
- ✅ **Projects Manager** - Full CRUD operations
- ✅ **Donations Manager** - View all donations
- ✅ **Dashboard Stats** - Live statistics
- ✅ **Image Upload** - Supabase Storage

---

## 🚀 How It Works:

### Homepage (`/`):
```
1. Page loads
2. Fetches active projects from Supabase
3. Shows top 3 projects
4. Displays with progress bars
5. Real-time data from database
```

### Projects Page (`/projects`):
```
1. Page loads
2. Fetches all active projects
3. Shows in grid layout
4. Click project → View details
5. All data from database
```

### Donation Form (`/donate`):
```
1. User fills form
2. Selects amount
3. Enters name and email
4. Clicks "Donate Now"
5. Saves to donations table
6. Shows success message
```

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`):
```
1. Login required
2. Manage projects (CRUD)
3. View donations
4. Upload images
5. See live stats
```

## 📊 Data Flow:

### Frontend → Database:
```
User Action → Component → Helper Function → Supabase → Database
```

### Database → Frontend:
```
Database → Supabase → Helper Function → Component → User Sees Data
```

### Example: Viewing Projects
```
1. User visits homepage
2. HomePage.tsx calls getActiveProjects()
3. Helper queries Supabase
4. Data returns from projects table
5. Component formats and displays
6. User sees real projects!
```

### Example: Making Donation
```
1. User fills donation form
2. Clicks "Donate Now"
3. DonationForm.tsx calls createDonation()
4. Helper inserts into donations table
5. Success message shows
6. Admin can see donation in dashboard
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### "No projects showing on homepage"
**Check:**
1. Did you run the SQL file?
2. Are there active projects in database?
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify `.env` file exists

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if projects exist
# Go to Supabase → Table Editor → projects
# Should see sample projects with status='active'
```

### "Donation not saving"
**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Supabase logs for errors
4. RLS policies allow inserts

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policy in Supabase
SELECT * FROM donations; -- Should work for authenticated users
```

### "Images not loading"
**Check:**
1. Image URLs are valid
2. Storage bucket is public
3. Images uploaded successfully
4. Network tab shows 200 status

**Solution:**
```
1. Go to Supabase → Storage → project-images
2. Check if images exist
3. Verify bucket is public
4. Test image URL in browser
```
