   - Minimum 1200x800 pixels
   - Clear and well-lit
   - Relevant to the project

2. **Optimize Before Upload**
   - Compress large images
   - Use tools like TinyPNG
   - Keep under 2MB for faster loading

3. **Choose Good Photos**
   - Show the project in action
   - Include people if possible
   - Use bright, engaging images

4. **Aspect Ratios**
   - 3:2 (1200x800) - Best for cards

## 🔄 How It Works (Technical):

### Upload Process:
```
1. User selects image file
2. File validates (type & size)
3. Preview generates (FileReader)
4. User clicks "Create/Update Project"
5. Image uploads to Supabase Storage
6. Public URL generated
7. URL saved in database
8. Project created/updated
```

### Code Flow:
```typescript
handleImageChange() → validates file → creates preview
handleSubmit() → uploadImage() → gets public URL → saves project
```
