### Issue: "Table already exists"
**Solution:** The table is already created. No action needed.

### Issue: "Permission denied for storage"
**Solution:** Run `fix-storage.sql`

### Issue: "Cannot insert into projects"
**Solution:** Check RLS policies. Re-run `setup.sql`

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution:** 
1. Run `fix-storage.sql`
2. Check file size (max 5MB)
3. Verify file type (images only)

1. **Create new Supabase project** for production
2. **Run `setup.sql`** in production database
3. **Update environment variables** in `.env`:

   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_key
   ```
4. **Test thoroughly** before going live
5. **Remove sample data** if not needed
